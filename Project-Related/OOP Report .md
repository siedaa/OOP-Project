**1. Executive Summary**

**Overview:**  
M&I Candy Pop is a C++ object-oriented programming (OOP) project
developed to simulate a Candy Crush-style game. This project involves
applying core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and
polymorphism to design and implement game logic, a GUI, and file
handling functionalities.

**Key Findings:**

- Successfully built a functioning match-three game with an intuitive
  user interface.

- Integrated file handling to store player name and scores.

- Demonstrated solid understanding of OOP concepts in practical
  application.

**2. Introduction**

**Background:**  
This project is part of the Object-Oriented Programming course to
practically apply theoretical knowledge by developing a game from
scratch using classes and object interactions.

**Project Objectives:**

- Design a modular, maintainable, and user-interactive game using C++
  OOP.

- Include a scoring system and implement file handling to store user
  data and scores.

- Provide an engaging SFML Graphics experience.

**3. Project Description**

**Scope:**

- Included: Board, Candy, Player, Sound-Effects, Main-Menu, Graphics.

- Excluded: Online multiplayer, network integration, AI-based player.

**Technical Overview:**

- Programming Language: C++

- IDE: Visual Studio Code

- Tools: C++, SFML, file handling (data.txt)

**4. Methodology**

**Approach:**

- Weekly planning for game mechanics, SFML setup, and testing.

- Divided tasks based on strengths: one focused on logic and file
  handling, the other on GUI and game flow.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

- Initially, we divided the console-based code.

- Collectively, we debugged the code.

- After understanding SFML, we applied it collectively.

**5. Project Implementation**

**Design and Structure:**

- Candy class: Generarting candies of different types.

- Player class: Manages player name and score.

- Board class: Handles game board and candy matching logic.

- Sound Effects class: Manages selection, matching & error sounds.

- MainMenu class: Manages user interaction and game navigation including
  graphics.

- MainGame class: Manages the main game.

**Functionalities Developed:**

- Match-3 gameplay with real-time scoring.

- Save name & scores using file handling.

- Simple, functional SFML for both Menu & Main game.

- Sounds & Bouncing animation applied on candies.

**Challenges Faced:**

- Game logics (logic with the candies popping horizontally or
  vertically)

- SFML compatibility -- required adaptation to available C++ GUI tools.

**6. Results**

**Project Outcomes:**

- Fully playable game with candy crush-style logic.

- Functional score tracking system implemented with file handling to
  save scores; continuation feature is under development and may be
  enhanced in the future.

**Testing and Validation:**

- Manual playtesting for each module.

- Checked continuously for saving scores.

- Checked for different background images, buttons graphics and setup.

**7. Conclusion**

**Summary of Findings:**  
The M&I Candy Pop project successfully applied core OOP concepts to
design a modular and interactive game. It achieved all major objectives
including score handling and SFML integration.

**Final Remarks:**  
This project not only reinforced theoretical OOP knowledge but also
enhanced skills in debugging, user interface design, and logical
thinking
